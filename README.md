resolving merge conflicts requires conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like how version control makes it very easy to collaborate and tell what is going on. It's very easy to see history and make changes from different locations. The most annoying part is probably merge conflicts. Not necessarily resolving them but ust paying enough attention to prevent them in the first place.
